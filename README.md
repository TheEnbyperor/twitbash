# TwitBash

A twitter bot allowing use of the bash terminal through direct messages

keys.py will need to be created to get this to work with contents so:
```
consumer_key = 'enter_key'
consumer_secret = 'enter_key'
access_token = 'enter_key'
access_token_secret = 'enter_key'
```

Control characters can be sent like so: ^Ctrl+\[key code\] \(C, V, X, etc\)
